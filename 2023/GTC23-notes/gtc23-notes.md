# GTC23  Notes

## Introduction 

This post is largely a list of the sessions I attended and many others that are still on my list to check out. I have included a few notes on the sessions I found particularly interesting.

It's a lot of sessions!  Most of these should be available on-demand after the conference. I will update this post with links to the videos as they become available. You can also search the web 

Two sites to check for on-demand videos are:
[GTC On Demand](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/on-demand/) and [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/gtc)
[NVIDIA On-Demand](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/)

## The Most Important Announcement at GTC23

The best announcement this year was that **next year GTC will be live and in-person again** (as well as available virtually). I have missed the in-person experience. GTC has been my favorite conference for the last 10 years. It will be great to have face-to-face conversations with people again. They will need to find a much larger venue than the San Jose McEnery Convention Center!

## Stats
- 733 sessions
