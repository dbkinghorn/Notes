# "Notes"

This README is derived from my post at [Puget Systems, 'Notes on "Notes" (new blog post format)'](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/Notes-on-Notes-new-blog-post-format-1646/).

This repo is the source for (static) site generation for "Notes" posts 

## What I want to do...
- Do more writing
- Document everything
- Automate everything
- Share everything
- Learn more things 
- Learn in public
- Use Git/GitHub 
- ...
  
 Some of those are overly general. Phrases like "foo **more** bar, and foobar **everything**" don't really specify an actionable plan, but, they do at least hint at something good to do. "**Learn in public**" is intriguing, ... could be good conversation starter at a party ... for nerds. "**Use Git/GitHub**", should probably be followed with "for everything". 
 
 Something that is specific and related to that list is a new blog post format that I want to try for 2020, "**Notes**". "Notes" connotes brevity and specificity. The "gist" of things. Put those out in public!  
 
 ## Why?
 I enjoy writing especially when the result is something that is helpful to someone, ... anyone, including myself. The sentiment of "what I want to do" is document and organize what I'm working on/with and share that with the world. This also gives me an accessible reference for the things I'm learning/re-learning(for the 10th time).  
 
 ## "Notes"?

 This is intended to be **"on-the-fly micro blogging"**. The idea is to post snippets of well formated, information, while working. And, do this in a way that is minimally disruptive to workflow. 
 
...I was originally thinking I would try to use GitHub Gists for this using a nifty looking  VS-code plugin called [GistPad](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gistfs). However, I could not reconcile organizational difficulties (and at this time GistPad is very much "under development")



 The Notes will include,
 - short description
 - code blocks
 - command line sessions
 - screenshots, images
 - examples
 - maybe short screen-casts

A single problem, idea or action per "Note".

There will be a **Master Index Page** organizing listings by category for all of the notes. 
Categories added as they arise. Accumulating as a mix of system-administration (DevOps), programming, ML/AI, Science, and brief HowTos.  

The accumulated "notes" could form the basis of longer documents about the different catagories.

Success with this will depend on automation! It needs to go something like; Idea/problem/inspiration --> create markdown along with snippets , commands etc. plus metadata --> commit, push --> trigger post/site generation, publish, notifications, tweet etc. All of that with one command. 

## What could go wrong?

- **If it breaks "flow" then it will not work.** 
- If I get too "involved" in the notes then it will be too disruptive. That means I have to resist rambling on with needless chatter, like I'm doing right now ...  
- It has to "spark joy"! The good feeling from putting up more helpful posts has to be self rewarding. If it becomes a tedious chore then it won't work.
- Technical difficulties? Yes, there could be some of those. I haven't worked out all of the details yet.
- It needs to become a habit. After I get the functional details completely worked out I'll commit to doing it for at least a month before I evaluate effectiveness. We'll see how it goes!

**I will still be doing longer posts. The in depth HowTos, hardware testing, etc. will continue at [Puget Systems HPC blog](https://www.pugetsystems.com/all_hpc.php).**


**Happy computing! --dbk**
